{"tagline":"An R interface to EBI's Ontology Lookup Service.","body":"### The Ontology Lookup Service \r\n\r\nThe [Ontology Lookup Service](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/) (OLS), developed at the [European Bioinformatics Institute](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/) (EBI), is a unified web interface to query multiple ontologies from a single location. It also provides Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) webservice for programmatic access.\r\n\r\n### The `rols` R package\r\n\r\nThe `rols` package uses functionality from the [SSOAP](http://www.omegahat.org/SSOAP/) and [XMLSchema](http://www.omegahat.org/XMLSchema/) packages to query the OLS directly from R. It also uses some functionality from the [Biobase](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biobase.html) package.\r\n\r\n### The `CVParam` class\r\n\r\nThe `CVParam` S4 class allows to generate controlled vocabulary parameters for all 88 ontologies through the OLS, as used in the frame of the [Proteomics Standards Initiative](http://www.psidev.info/) (PSI) effort. \r\n\r\n### Installation \r\n`rols` is available from the [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org) repository. The package and its dependencies can be installed \r\n```\r\nsource(\"http://www.bioconductor.org/biocLite.R\")\r\nbiocLite(\"rols\")\r\n```\r\nSee also the `rols` [Bioconductor page](http://bioconductor.org/packages/2.11/bioc/html/rols.html) for on-line access to the vignette and the reference manual.\r\n\r\nThe code on [github](https://github.com/lgatto/rols) is for sharing, testing, issue tracking and forking/pulling purposes. The **official source code** is available from the [Bioconductor svn server](https://hedgehog.fhcrc.org/bioconductor/trunk/madman/Rpacks/). Get is with \r\n```\r\nsvn co https://hedgehog.fhcrc.org/bioconductor/trunk/madman/Rpacks/rols\r\n```\r\n(user name: `readonly`, password: `readonly`)\r\n\r\n \r\n### Help\r\n`rols` comes with plenty of documentation. Have a start with the vignette ``vignette(\"rols\", package=\"rols\")``. Do not hesitate to contact me for questions/comments/suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Building from source\r\n\r\nSome of the functions in rols are documented with the [roxygen2](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen)\r\n([CRAN package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html)). \r\nThe respective Rd pages have been created with\r\n```\r\nR --vanilla -e \"library(roxygen2); roxygenize('\"$(PKG)\"', roclets=\\\"rd\\\")\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that only the `rd` roclet has been used, i.e. only `roxygen`'s Rd-generation \r\nfunctionality. `roxygen` can also generate the NAMESPACE (`namespace` roclet) and \r\nparts of (?) the DESCRIPTION (previous and `collate` roclet) files, which is not used here. \r\nIf all roclets are used, some original data will be overwritten.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
